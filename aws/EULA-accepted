The following Houdini Cloud EULA has been accepted on Tue, 04 Jun 2013 at 16:32:00:


HQUEUE CLOUD COMPUTING END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
=============================================

The following disclaimer refers to the use of Side Effects Software's
products("Software") in conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud Computing Platform ("Cloud").  This disclaimer does not replace
the existing Software EULA.

The user agrees that any use of the Software via the Cloud is strictly
at the risk of the user.  Side Effects Software does not guarantee the
operability of its Software using the Cloud, and assumes no liability
for any financial, time, or other damages that may result from the use
of the Software in conjunction with the Cloud. 

There are no express warranties implied and persons using the
Software in the Cloud bear complete risk for any incidental, special,
indirect, or consequential damages, loss of revenues or profits, or
any other damages; however caused.  Notwithstanding, in no event
shall Side Effects Software's liability for any damages exceed the
original amount paid for the original license grant.

The user agrees that Software in the Cloud may not be subleased,
shared or reassigned.  Users of Apprentice software (i.e. non-
commercial versions of the Software) may only use the cloud for non-
commercial work as per the terms of their EULA.

The user is strongly advised to read the user guide and follow its
instructions carefully.  The following recommendations will increase the
likelihood of a successful result:

* Ensure that the Cloud billing structure is understood in detail before
  using the Cloud.  Billing is handled by Amazon and not by Side Effects
  Software.

* Ensure that the Software version (typically the latest production
  release of the Software) is compatible with the software version in
  the Cloud.  The use of different build versions of Houdini significantly
  increase the risk of producing different results, unsatisfactory results,
  or no results at all. 

* Correctly and completely identify and select all required input files
  when submitting a job.  While some attempt has been made to find file
  dependencies automatically, it is not possible to always detect file
  references in all circumstances.  Files referenced in complex
  expressions, scripts and C++ code are unlikely to be detected.

* Ensure your job is not using or dependent on HDK plugins, environment
  settings, custom paths, etc.

* Check jobs locally before submitting them to the Cloud. 

* Start with a single machine in the Cloud and one frame to make sure
  things are working before submitting a large job to multiple machines.

* Ensure your cloud instances are shut down.  Cloud users are billed as
  long as an instance is running, whether it is in use or not.

You must accept these terms and conditions to use the Software in the Cloud.
